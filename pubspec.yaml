# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - .env
    - assets/images/
    - assets/icons_svg/
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:

  fonts:
    - family: poppinsBold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Bold.otf

    - family: poppinsMedium
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Medium.otf

    - family: poppinsExtraBold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-ExtraBold.otf

    - family: poppinsRegular
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Regular.otf

    - family: poppinsBlack
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Black.otf

    - family: poppinsLight
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Light.otf

    - family: poppinsThin
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Thin.otf
